# weather_app

Technologies that I use for this project are JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, luxon, unicons, and react-toastify.
We will fetch data from OpenWeather endpoints.
We will be getting temperature, max, min, humidity, real feel, sunrise, sunset, hourly, and daily forecast.
We will also display the local time at the selected location.
For input, there are some quick links on top along with a text box for searching a city and also a current location-based search.
